# fe_e_swiz

A couple of python scripts to swizzle and/or unswizzle textures for the game Fire Emblem: Engage

Python3 as well as PIL and numpy are required for use

To use, just drag and drop an image onto either swizzle.bat or unswizzle.bat (image must be in the same folder as python scripts and bat files)

Only 2048x2048, 1024x1024 and 512x512 images are supported at the moment

Code for unswizzling textures was originally written by CherishingWish @ https://github.com/CherishingWish/
